## Tue March 15: Recap week 1 and 2

WEEK 1

I binge watched all zoom sessions on the way back from Austria, and Lucas Evers' elaborate presentation on biohacking got me wired to get started! I was especially struck by Ionat Zurr's presentation since I know SymbioticA lab from my research on biolabs and it is one of the most exiting and earliest biolabs embedded within an art university that I came across. Getting the github website up was a bit challengeing, until I figured out that every user gets a free "Github Page" website only on their main repository, not on the subrepository I created for it. Reading back that is actually mentioned in the instructions...

WEEK 2
Unfortunately this weekend my daughter came down with Covid and I didn't think it was safe for me to go to Waag physically on Monday. I was glad to be that careful because on Tuesday I became sick as well. I followed the zoom sessions as best I could, luckily I already have experience in digital fabrication and electronics,
