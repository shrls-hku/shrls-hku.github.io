### Design fiction & Green Fluorescent Proteins
This full week is a bit different as we are joined by the participants of the Hybrid Lab Network, a European network of bioscience labs from Amsterdam, LJubljana, Helsinki and Porto, that share knowledge on innovative educational practices. 

On Monday we attended two lectures on genetically modified organisms (GMO's) - one on the basics of genetic manipulation by Kas Houthuijs and another on creative uses of GMO by Lucas Evers. In the afternoon we had our first experience (well, my second) in genetically modifying an organism, when we used the *pGLO Bacterial Transformation and GFP Kit* to transfer a piece of genetic information from a deep sea jellyfish (the ability to produce a fluorescent protein) into the DNA of a colony of e.coli bacteria.
