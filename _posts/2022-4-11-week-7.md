### Proteins!
The week started off with a lecture by John La Cava, of Rockefeller NY and Groningen University, whose team has developed a new scientific aproach to studying protein interactions and their role in the development of diseases. Especially of interest for him is the proliferation of parasitic genes known as LINE-1 retrotransposons. LINE-1 genes use a “copy and paste” mechanism to expand within the human genome, and as such play an important (but not yet fully understood) role in the genome of cancer patients. La Cava uses Cas-9 to insert LINE-1 into DNA in vitro to study its effects. It was a tough lecture to follow because of its very specialized content and our limited knowledge up to that point, but for me it did open up the vastness of research done in cell biology, the current limits of what we are able to know about the building blocks of life, and the role chance plays in it all.
