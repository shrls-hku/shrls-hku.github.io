## Mon March 15: Recap week 1 and 2

WEEK 1
I binge watched all zoom sessions on the way back from Austria, and Lucas Evers' elaborate presentation on biohacking got me exited to get started! I was especially struck by Ionat Zurr's presentation since I know SymbioticA lab from my research on biolabs and it is one of the most exiting places I came across.
