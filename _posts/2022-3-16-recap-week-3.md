title: Week 3: Making an incubator
---

Still online this week as I'm not entirely better, but I'm exited to get building and I have quite some tools and stuff at home so that should work. I decided to go with the incubator since I have a lot of styrofoam let over from insulation, I have an Arduino and a cooking thermometer.
