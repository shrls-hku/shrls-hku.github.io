### Lichens & Mushrooms & Algae & Bacteria
Monday started off with a fascinating talk by Andrea Knouf on her research on Lichen (korstmossen, in Dutch) as ecosystems consisting of symbiotic relationships between algae, or cyanobacteria and fungi. As a trans woman she is interested in the lichen as an 'alien' species on earth, and has, through MIT and NASA managed to send some of her work to the ISS and back. Andrea also gave a workshop on microscopy, which opened up possibilities to use this scientfic tool as an artistic tool through the use of alternate (old, broken) lenses, diy adapters and 3D-printed filters meant to direct the light in novel ways.
