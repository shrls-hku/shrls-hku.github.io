##### 18/2 FIRST IDEAS

##### 1. Algae for the living material archive
I would like to build an algae bioreactor/cultivator for the HKU biolab with space to grow various species of macroalgae (seaweed) and microalgae (phytoplankton) and control conditions such as lighting and temperature. I want to make these materials, samples and the knowledge about them available to the students for use in e.g. biomaterial making and textile dyeing, but also to convey the idea that energy can be harvested with biomass and how algae can be a really powerful food source. How can an installation basically inspire more exeriments an research on this organism?

##### 2. Printing and displaying living materials
In my own time I've been experimenting with growing layers of mycelium on RISO prints, planning to later stencil layers or 3d print nutrients. I would like to futher pursue and extend this by
1. exploring the relation between by using various organisms (myceliums, bacteria, yeasts, algae?) visually in the work, e.g. as either consecutive layers or in concert, allowing competition as part of the design process. 
2. exploring other materials s.a. ceramics as a base
3. developing a way to keep the work / this kind of work alive and contained and displaying it outside of the lab

##### 3. External biolab display
As the HKU biolab is at present quite hidden, I would like to build a mobile safety cabinet/display that is safe and attractive in which we can showcase work that is in development and alive and wouldn't otherwise be able to leave the lab. Is this even possible, and under what circumstances?
